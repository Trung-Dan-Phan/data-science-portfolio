# Data Scientist

**About Me**
------------

I gratuated from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/about/about-desautels/rankings) in December 2022 with a degree in [Mathematics](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/faculties/desautels/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-commerce-bcom-major-mathematics-and-statistics-management) and [Business Analytics](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/faculties/desautels/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-commerce-bcom-concentration-business-analytics). I am now continuing to improve my skills at Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris with a [master's degree in data science](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/master/programs/data-science-for-business-joint-degree-with-hec). I aspire to use my knowledge and expertise to provide data-driven solutions for better business decisions. In addition to my passion of data science, I enjoy playing tennis ðŸŽ¾ and composing music ðŸŽµ. I am always willing to learn new traits.

### **NielsenIQ Digital Purchases (formerly Foxintelligence)** (April-August 2024)

I joined the data science team to improve the performance of a product categorization model which relied solely on product names. My contribution was implementing a flexible Multimodal Transformer model to integrate textual, numerical, and categorical features, improving product classification accuracy by 2%, just by adding product prices.

### **BCG-X Data Challenge - Customer Churn Prediction & AI Strategy Development** (February 2025) 

I collaborated with strategic management students to identify and prioritize 10 AI-driven data use cases for a B2B construction products distributor, selecting churn prediction as the most valuable using an Impact-Feasibility Matrix. A Logistic Regression model was developed, achieving 96% precision and 77% recall in identifying at-risk customers.
