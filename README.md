# Data Scientist

**About Me**
------------

I gratuated from [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/desautels/about/about-desautels/rankings) in December 2022 with a degree in [Mathematics](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/faculties/desautels/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-commerce-bcom-major-mathematics-and-statistics-management) and [Business Analytics](https://www.mcgill.ca/study/2024-2025/faculties/desautels/undergraduate/programs/bachelor-commerce-bcom-concentration-business-analytics). I am now continuing to improve my skills at Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris with a [master's degree in data science](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/en/master/programs/data-science-for-business-joint-degree-with-hec). I aspire to use my knowledge and expertise to provide data-driven solutions for better business decisions. In addition to my passion of data science, I enjoy playing tennis ðŸŽ¾ and composing music ðŸŽµ. I am always willing to learn new traits.

### Schneider Electric - Plastic Cost Prediction	December 2024 

![Schneider Electric](docs/schneider_electric.png)

* Designed data preprocessing pipelines, merging over 10 datasets (e.g., macroeconomic indicators, raw material prices) and ensuring consistency through timestamp alignment, format unification, and missing value imputation.
* Implemented and evaluated forecasting models to forecast Polycarbonate and Green Polycarbonate prices for 3, 6, and 9 months, with NBEATS achieving the best-performance with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.1155.
* Delivered strategic business insights by correlating cost forecasts with Schneider Electricâ€™s pricing and competitor data, enabling informed procurement and pricing decisions.
